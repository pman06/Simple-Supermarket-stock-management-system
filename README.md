# Simple-Supermarket-stock-management-system

## This is a simple supermarket stock management system . Items can be added to stocks. And processing orders makes certain that all stocked products are deducted accordingly to reflect the current available amout. From the view peoduct, expired products can be found as well.

## THis was designed using C++ and QT Creator for the GUI design.

This can be further improved on to include even more detailed report page of purchases and stock history of vaious products. Inclding a module to notify of expiring products too will be a plus.
